Simple command line interface for quickly accessing your Monzo account info,
current balance, latest transactions, etc.

It currently suffers from the same issue that the underlying [pymonzo][pymonzo]
suffers - short lifespan of access tokens.

## Installation
From PyPI:
```shell
$ pip install monzo
```

## Usage
To use the library you have to provide it with you Monzo
[access token][monzo developer playground]. You can either do that by exporting
it as an environment variable (`$ export MONZO_ACCESS_TOKEN='...'`) or by
passing it explicitly with each command.

```shell
$ monz --help 
Usage: monz [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Simple command line interface for quickly accessing your Monzo account
  info, current balance, latest transactions, etc.

  To use it you need to save your Monzo access token as 'MONZO_ACCESS_TOKEN'
  environment variable (export MOZNO_ACCESS_TOKEN='...') or pass it
  explicitly with each command.

Options:
  -t, --access-token TEXT  Monzo API access token.
  --help                   Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  accounts      Show connected Monzo accounts
  balance       Show Monzo account balance
  transactions  Show Monzo account transactions
```

## Examples


## Tests
Package was tested with the help of `py.test` and `tox` on Python 2.7, 3.4
and 3.5 (see `tox.ini`).

To run tests yourself you need to set environment variables with access token
before running `tox` inside the repository:
```shell
$ export MONZO_ACCESS_TOKEN='...'
$ tox
```
